# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.editorconfig
.git
.gitignore

node_modules

# IMPORTANT NOTICE
#
# Unlike the default .gcloudignore file that gets generated by gcloud tool, this
# version DOES NOT include .gitignore. Word "include" has two meanings here: the
# file is still listed as ignored in the one of the lines above, but it's
# contents are not exported to this file when it is evaluated.
#
# The reason for this is because we need to build Javascript files from our
# Typescript files, and on one hand, not include them in our repository (because
# they are build artefacts, not source), but on the other, upload them to GCF.
